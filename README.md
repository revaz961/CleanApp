# CleanApp

**This is a work in progress experimental project and is not intended as production-ready code**. It's currently in a development process and many more features will be implemented soon.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide an easy house cleaning service to its users. The app has two modes: **service-receiver** and **service-provider** ones.


## Description

After registration, the service-receiver can choose what type of cleaning service does he/she want to receive:
_After party_, _Simple cleaning_, _After renovation_, _Deep cleaning_ or _Garden cleaning_. Then choose their preferable day and time, indicate the number of rooms to clean and prodive their location. Then he/she will find the masters, filtered by the previous inputs. After confirmation and reservation of the master, master will receive the notification that his/her service is needed. The client and the master can have in-app chat to exchange more details that is based on _Firebase realtime database_.

On the other hand, any user can activate their master's profile, where they can indicate which category of cleaning do they want to provide, indidcate their fee and cancellation policy.
